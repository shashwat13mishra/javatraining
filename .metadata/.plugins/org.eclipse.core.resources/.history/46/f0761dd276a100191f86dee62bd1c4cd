/*
 * Create a class called Circle with following members :
an int type data member called radius
a constructor to accept the radius
a method called getShapeName() which returns "Circle"
a method named computeArea() which returns the area of a the circle
Create a class CircleApp (with a main) which instantiates and 
displays areas of circle objects with different radii
In both of the above classes, should the user be able to directly access the fields?
What would be the impact of providing setter methods in these classes? Say if we were to introduce a 'draw' method?
Complete the above before reading/proceeding further
